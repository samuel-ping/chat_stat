# Tools

## name_changer.py

This tool changes the names of a person in your message history file. This is useful for normalizing names between multiple conversations. NOTE: If you're trying to modify a name with whitespaces, use double quotes ("") around that name in the command line so it registers as a single argument.

### Usage

```bash
$ python name_changer.py <name> <new name> <message history file(s)>
```
